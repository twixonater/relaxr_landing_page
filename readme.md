Relaxr Landing Page: Part 1
==================

We'll be working on this site for the next three classes, just a heads up.

For today, we'll be making a simplified version of the site which uses only one column. Your job is to build out the CSS - using the information below - for the page!

Tip: You should not have duplicate style blocks. Look out for styles in the list below that are similar and use classes to style the elements.
